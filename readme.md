## About
This is a basic operating system mock-up made from python GUI module tkinter.
It has a few interactive apps to navigate through.

There are 2 main screens, apart from the various app screens.
At first, you're confronted with the welcome screen, where you're supposed to enter your password within 5 tries. On login, you enter the app drawer, where you can choose from a grid of apps.

## Setup and Usage
**Make sure you have python3 installed on your system. If not, download python3 from [here](https://www.python.org/).**<br>
**Note: If you get a tkinter error on running the file, install tk separately on your system.**
